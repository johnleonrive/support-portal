<p><strong>Response time:</strong> Within 1 hour</p>

<h3>High</h3>
<p><strong>Use when:</strong> Major feature is broken, significant workflow disruption, no workaround available.</p>
<p><strong>Response time:</strong> Within 4 hours (business hours)</p>

<h3>Medium</h3>
<p><strong>Use when:</strong> Non-critical bugs, feature requests, questions with a workaround available.</p>
<p><strong>Response time:</strong> Within 1 business day</p>

<h3>Low</h3>
<p><strong>Use when:</strong> Minor enhancements, documentation questions, general feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Response time:</strong> Within 2-3 business days</p>

<h2>Tips</h2>
